## Folder "developing"
* This folder is the developing workspace. 
* Make a branch with your name
* In the beginning stage, we plan to invite everyone develop a basic structure on their own, which is expected to fulfill really basic function including moving, shooting and communication.

## Folder "useable"
* This folder is used to store the mature, fine-tested, faultless versions of the codes.
* The basic functions including movement, shooting, power restriction and remote control are expected to realised in every version.
* The criterion is that the code is able to use in the competetion without fatal error.
* For every newly-added version, please update the <u>version recording.txt</u>.
