# Standard
This repository stores several frameworks of standard (infantry) robot embeded code.

___WARNING: THESE MATERIALS ARE ONLY FOR MEMBERS IN HKU ROBOMASTER. DON NOT DISCLOSE!!!___

## Folder "RM步兵大疆开源代码"
* This is the official framework written by DJI.
* It has implemented most of functions we use and there is a guideline to refer to. Change the encoding of files from utf-8 to Simplified Chinese (GB 2312) and then you can read the Chinese comments for every function, which is really helpful for your learning.
* However the modulization and capsulation is relatively bad. And it stoped updating since 2019.
  
  ___DO NOT MERGE ANYTHING TO MAIN BRANCH!!!___
  
## Folder "mecanum-a-master"
* This is the framework from HNU.
* It seems that HKU HerKules is not going to implement this framework... But its structure is clear and meaningful to learn.
* Learning material: 【跃鹿干货 · 电控篇 | basic_framework整体架构介绍】 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Bd4y1E7CN/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=f7277ce15cb23819c387a0d02c260a1d

## Folder "官步"
* This is a "new version of official framework".
* It has a clearer structure and some better configuration. It is useful for hand-on learning.

  ___DO NOT MERGE ANYTHING TO MAIN BRANCH!!!___
  
## Folder "useable"
* This folder is used to store the mature, fine-tested, faultless versions of the codes.
* The basic functions including movement, shooting, power restriction and remote control are expected to realised in every version.
* The criterion is that the code is able to use in the competetion without fatal error.
* For every newly-added version, please update the <u>version recording.txt</u>.
